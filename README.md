## General Information
- This website is a user friendly, mobile responsive and informational interface catered to those seeking culinary inspiration! Users can search for    recipes right from the homepage, browse a list of recipe cards and view the most relevant details for each one, including a summary, ingredients,     directions, as well as, which wine(s) best accompany the meal. 


## Technologies Used
- Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Frameworks: React
- Styling: Material UI, CSS
- Databases: None (This is a front end application)
- APIs: Spoonacular API


## Features
Ready features:
- Landing page featuring enticing imagery and pleasant color palette, as well as, a search bar and button. 
- A mock email sign up that generates pop up messages based on empty and non-empty responses.
- A search results page displaying three cards per row, containing recipe image, title and a link to view recipe details.
- A recipe details page featuring title, image, number of servings and the time it takes in the kitchen to get to your table.
- Each details page also features a menu of tabs with each one focusing on the description, ingredients, directions and wine pairing advice. This was   designed to minimize the amount of scrolling normally associated with conventional recipe websites.
